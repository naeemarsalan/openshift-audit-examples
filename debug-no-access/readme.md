### **Critical Fields to Alert On**
1. **`verb`**:  
   - Value: `get`  
   - Indicates the action attempted on a resource. Alert if sensitive operations like `exec`, `get`, or `proxy` are being attempted on critical resources.

2. **`objectRef.resource`**:  
   - Value: `nodes`  
   - Refers to the resource type being accessed. Access to `nodes` is significant as it might expose infrastructure details or enable privileged actions.

3. **`objectRef.name`**:  
   - Value: `ba-c2-aa-ef-1b-82`  
   - The specific node being targeted. You should monitor attempts to access high-value nodes.

4. **`annotations.authorization.k8s.io/decision`**:  
   - Value: `forbid`  
   - Indicates the access was denied. Successful access (`allow`) to critical resources should trigger an alert.

5. **`responseStatus.code`**:  
   - Value: `403`  
   - Denotes the HTTP response code. Alert on unauthorized access (403) or attempts that return success (200) for sensitive resources.

6. **`responseStatus.reason`**:  
   - Value: `Forbidden`  
   - Clarifies why the request was denied. Look out for `Forbidden`, as it indicates an attempted but blocked operation.

7. **`user.username`**:  
   - Value: `dev1`  
   - The username attempting the action. Alert on unauthorized users or unusual activity from specific accounts.

8. **`user.groups`**:  
   - Value: `sre`, `system:authenticated:oauth`, etc.  
   - Review the groups the user belongs to, especially if they have elevated privileges (e.g., `cluster-admin`).

9. **`userAgent`**:  
   - Value: `oc/4.17.0 (linux/amd64) kubernetes/f4525b8`  
   - Monitors the tool or client used. Alert if unusual or unauthorized clients are used.

10. **`sourceIPs`**:  
    - Value: `172.99.0.106`  
    - The IP address of the client initiating the request. Alert on non-whitelisted or unusual IPs.

### **Additional Fields for Context**
- **`stage`**:  
  - Value: `ResponseComplete`  
  - Indicates the stage of the request lifecycle. Track completed requests for auditing.

- **`requestURI`**:  
  - Value: `/api/v1/nodes/ba-c2-aa-ef-1b-82`  
  - The specific API endpoint being accessed. Monitor sensitive or unusual API calls.

- **`timestamp`** and **`stageTimestamp`**:  
  - Useful for tracking activity patterns and potential incidents.

- **`user.extra.scopes.authorization.openshift.io`**:  
  - Provides additional context about the user's scope, which may help identify overprivileged accounts.

### **Alerting Recommendations**
1. **Unauthorized Access Attempts**:
   - Alert when `annotations.authorization.k8s.io/decision` is `forbid` for sensitive resources like `nodes`.

2. **Successful Access**:
   - Trigger an alert for `responseStatus.code = 200` on resources like `nodes` or actions like `exec`.

3. **Unusual Users/Clients**:
   - Monitor for unexpected users (`user.username`) or unauthorized `userAgent`.

4. **Source IP Monitoring**:
   - Alert on access attempts from suspicious or external IP addresses (`sourceIPs`).

5. **Targeted Resource**:
   - Watch for sensitive resources like `objectRef.resource = nodes` and alert if the activity deviates from normal patterns.
